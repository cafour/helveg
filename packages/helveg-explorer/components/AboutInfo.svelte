    <em>Helveg</em> is the product of my studies at the
    <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/" target="_blank">Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The <em>CodePizza</em> feature has been created as a part of the
    <em>PV097 Visual Creativity Informatics</em>
    course in spring 2023. <em>CodePizza</em> is dedicated to the now defunct <em>Pizza Nostra</em>, which used to make
    the weirdest looking pizza I have ever seen.
