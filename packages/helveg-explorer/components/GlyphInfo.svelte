    Glyphs are nodes of the diagram. The icon in the center represents the
    kind of the visualized entity. The outlines symbolize, in order from
    innermost to outermost:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>"Staticness"</strong>: If the line is dashed, the entity is
        static; if it is solid, it is tied to an instance.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Instance member count</strong>: The number of instance
        members inside a type entity. Always solid.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Static member count</strong>: The number of static members
        inside a type entity. Always dashed.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    If a node is on fire, there's an error in the entity it represents. The
    error is shown in the Properties panel. Similarly, if a node is
    smoldering, there's a warning.
